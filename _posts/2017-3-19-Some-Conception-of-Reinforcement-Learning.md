Dynamics of Markov Desion-making Process(MDP):

*Model-based Reinforcement Learning*:

Models assuming that the dynamics of MDP are known, such as dynamic programming

*Model-free Reinforcement Learning*:

Models like Monte-Carlo evaluation or temporal-difference learning, learning directly from experience and do not assume any
knowledge of the environmentâ€™s dynamics
